# CS4804 - Artificial Intelligence
* Courese description

	This course will introduce the foundations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and key ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. It will focus on concepts that are not only important in the space of AI but are also practically useful in modern applications. We will practice effective methods of reasoning about AI problems, which will generalize beyond the specific topics we study in class. Topics include (but are not limited to) search, game playing, logic, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, robotics and image processing. The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.
